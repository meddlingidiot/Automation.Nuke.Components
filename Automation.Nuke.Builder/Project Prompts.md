Keep in mind that this pipeline will be shared across 80+ projects
and by multiple developers. It is using Nuke build v10. I want to
make it easy to setup on a new project. Preferably as easy as
the nuke :setup process.


I am wanting to simplify the installation process of getting a project
setup to do the build. I am going to move the Automation.Nuke.Components
to a NuGet Package, but how do i do a nuke :setup then automate adding the
nuget package, and all other dependencies like GitVersion to get setup.
Plus I have some simple things like asking what the "goal" of this build
is which should install one of the DefaultBuilds (CompileBuild, TestBuild,
PackageBuild, etc). I think the goal is to make a global tool like nuke is
to build automate the installation so you could do "aftrnuke : setup" and
it would prompt for which Default build would you like to use, It would
dynamically load the builds based on which ones exist (code generation).
Then it would generate the build script based on the selected Default build.
It could ask some other questions: Do you want to fail the build on warnings?
Do you want to fail the build on code coverage? What is the min Code coverage
(int, percentage)? Do you want to fail the bulid on secrets leaked?

Create it in a project called Automation.Nuke.Builder or something like that.
Follow the pattern of Nuke's :setup process. Use Spectre Console for prompts.
Evaluate the _build project for dependencies and install them. Also examine
Automation.Nuke.Components for DefaultBuilds and Parameters for configuration
for the questions asked parameters.

Done! This created a .config/dotnet-tools.json manifest file that your build
server will automatically recognize. When the build server runs dotnet tool
restore, it will install GitVersion.Tool automatically.

upgrade build project to net10.0
if needed run dotnet tool update -g Nuke.GlobalTool
dotnet tool install GitVersion.Tool --version 6.5.1 --local
run nuke :add-package GitVersion.Tool --version 6.5.1
run nuke :add-package ReportGenerator --version 5.5.1
Delete Configuration.cs in root of _build project
include a .gitleaks.toml file
include a nuget.config file
include a GitVersion.yml file
DON'T include a dotnet-tools.json file (use the one you build)
